            <h2>About Me</h2><br>
            <p>Hi! I'm Charles!</p><br>
            <P>Welcome to Hero's Makerspace – a hub of creativity, learning, and exploration inspired by my Shiba Inu, Hero. </p>
            <br><P>For over 18 years, I've delved into the intricacies of aviation maintenance technology and the exhilarating world of aerospace as a jet engine mechanic. Beyond the hangar, my career has spanned cyber, industrial, and personal security domains, where I've applied the same precision and dedication required in the skies.</p>
            <br><p>My journey has been anything but linear. With the military as my backbone, providing a support network and a guaranteed paycheck, I've been free to chase my dreams and follow my passions. I've pursued studies in Psychology, International Relations, Game Art and Design, Aviation Maintenance Technology, and Software Development and Security. My career achievements are complemented by certifications like CompTIA Security+, AFSO21 Green Belt, Anti-terrorism Level II, and qualifications in Jet Engine and Aircraft operations.</p>
            <br><p>My curiosity didn't stop at formal education and certifications. Over the last two decades, I've embarked on various entrepreneurial adventures, launching several LLCs, solving problems with 2FA using Twilio's API while living overseas and venturing into drop shipping, print-on-demand, social media marketing, and freelance web development. One of my projects was even acquired by a major industry player.</p>
            <br><p> Hero's Makerspace is an extension of this eclectic journey. It's where I share my passion for building, creating, and discovering. This community and platform are designed to share insights across various interests—from DIY electronics projects and 3D printing adventures to game development mechanics and the nuances of art and design. My goal is to foster a community where learning is free, accessible, and engaging—a space for anyone to join me in exploring the wonders of technology, art, and their many intersections.</p>
