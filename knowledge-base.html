        <h2>Welcome to My Knowledge Base, this is still a work in progress, I have not started populating information yet, as I am just building the groundwork for what comes later</h2>
        <p>Here, you'll dive into what I've learned from years of tinkering with gadgets, coding late into the night, and sketching out ideas that turned into something bigger. It's all here: my journey through technology, art, and everything. This Knowledge Base? It's my digital notebook, where I store the bits and pieces of knowledge I've gathered along the way.</p>
        <p>But this isn't just for me. I'm throwing open the doors to my workshop, hoping you'll find something here that also lights a spark for you. There's no catch, no fees, no gates. Just knowledge freely shared. I'm not here to make a buck but to spread the word that learning doesn't have to come with a price tag. So, look around, see what catches your eye, and let's learn something new together without worrying about the cost.</p>
